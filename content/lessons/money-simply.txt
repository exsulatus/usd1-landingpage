# Money is a tool
Money is a tool people use to trade.

Long ago, people traded things like eggs for shoes. That was hard.
Money makes trading easier because we all agree it can stand in for many things.

Key idea: money is not “good” or “bad.” It is a tool. People choose how to use it.

# What money does (3 jobs)
Money usually does three jobs:

1) It helps us trade (a “medium of exchange”).
2) It helps us compare prices (a “unit of account”).
3) It helps us save for later (a “store of value”).

If money fails at a job, life gets confusing.

# Prices are messages
A price is like a tiny message:

- If a thing is scarce, the price often goes up.
- If a thing is easy to get, the price often goes down.

Prices can be wrong for a while. Hype, fear, or rules can bend them.
But in the long run, prices try to tell the truth.

# Saving vs spending
Saving means “I want more choices later.”
Spending means “I want something now.”

Neither is always right.
Good money habits are about balance:

- Save for safety.
- Spend for needs.
- Spend a little for joy.
