# The trenches are loud
The “trenches” is slang for fast, noisy markets.
Timelines move quick. Opinions are strong. Emotions run hot.

Your job is to keep your brain online.

# Risk is not a vibe
Risk means “a bad thing could happen.”

A vibe is just a feeling.
Feelings can be useful, but they aren’t proof.

Try this question:
“If I’m wrong, what do I lose?”

# Hype moves faster than truth
Hype is fast.
Truth is often slow.

When you feel FOMO, pause.
Take a breath.
Read the details.

If there are no details, that’s a detail.

# Simple decision checklist
Before you act, ask:

1) What is my plan?
2) What is my limit?
3) What would make me change my mind?
4) Am I trying to “win” or trying to learn?

Learning is a win.

# Communities can be great (and tricky)
Communities teach, share, and support.

But communities can also create pressure.
When you hear “everyone is doing it,” translate that to:
“Someone wants me to move fast.”

Moving slow is allowed.
