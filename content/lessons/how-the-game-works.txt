# The “money game” has rules
Money isn’t just paper or numbers.
It’s also rules: who can make it, how it moves, and what it can buy.

When the rules change, people feel it.

# Inflation (the simple idea)
Inflation means prices go up over time.

If prices go up, each dollar buys a little less.
That can happen for many reasons:

- More money is chasing the same stuff.
- Supplies are lower (less stuff to buy).
- People expect prices to rise and act differently.

# Incentives (why people do things)
An incentive is a reason to do something.

Examples:
- A discount makes you buy now.
- A fee makes you wait.
- A reward makes you keep playing.

Good systems try to line up incentives with good behavior.
Bad systems reward shortcuts.

# Trust is the quiet engine
Money works best when people trust it.

Trust comes from:
- Clear rules
- Fair enforcement
- Easy verification

In crypto, verification can be stronger (you can check on-chain).
But stories and hype can still confuse people.

# Stablecoins, memes, and attention
Some coins aim to be stable.
Some coins are memes.

Stability is about staying steady.
Memes are about attention and community.

Sometimes these worlds bump into each other.
When they do, stay calm and ask: “What is this trying to do?”
