  "footer.faq_title": "FAQ",
  "footer.faq_sub": "Calm answers, verified links, and a reminder to go slow.",
  "footer.faq_q1": "What is USD1?",
  "footer.faq_a1": "USD1 is a community-driven Solana memecoin focused on transparency, culture, and building something that lasts. It started as a typical memecoin, but the emphasis on verifiable on-chain activity and steady ecosystem development has shaped it into a memecoin that leans less on hype and more on transparency, community involvement, and long-term vision.",
  "footer.faq_q2": "Is this financial advice?",
  "footer.faq_a2": "No. This site exists for information, verification links, and project context — not investment advice. Crypto assets, especially memecoins, are volatile and can lose significant value. Only participate with what you can afford to lose.",
  "footer.faq_q3": "Where can I find the contract and verify it?",
  "footer.faq_a3": "Always use the official links on this site or our pinned announcements. Then independently confirm the mint address on Solscan, DexScreener, and your swap interface before trading. Never rely on random links, DMs, or screenshots.",
  "footer.faq_q4": "What are the locks and buybacks?",
  "footer.faq_a4": "Some USD1 tokens have been publicly locked on-chain, meaning they cannot be moved, sold, or accessed by anyone until the lock period expires. These locks are visible on-chain and set for specific unlock times. Buybacks have also been executed transparently, reducing circulating supply in a way anyone can verify through blockchain explorers.",
  "footer.faq_q5": "Where can I track charts, liquidity, and on-chain data?",
  "footer.faq_a5": "DexScreener is typically used for charts and liquidity visibility. Jupiter is commonly used for swaps. For detailed on-chain data — holders, transactions, and contract activity — use Solscan.",
  "footer.faq_q6": "Where do official updates and announcements happen?",
  "footer.faq_a6": "Updates are shared through the website and official social channels listed here. Always verify announcements across multiple official sources. Treat unsolicited DMs, replies, or \u201csupport\u201d messages as untrusted until confirmed.",
  "footer.faq_q7": "Why does the price move so quickly?",
  "footer.faq_a7": "Memecoins often trade in thinner, sentiment-driven markets. Price swings, slippage changes, and liquidity shifts can happen quickly — especially during high attention periods. Always double-check transaction settings before confirming trades.",
  "footer.faq_q8": "How is USD1 community-driven?",
  "footer.faq_a8": "A significant portion of the locked supply has come from community participation, not just the core contributors. Holders can choose to lock tokens, contribute ideas, create content, and help shape how the project grows. The goal is collaborative progress rather than top-down control.",

  "footer.howto_safety3": "Fast price movement can increase slippage. Double-check transaction settings before approving swaps.",
  "footer.howto_slippage_q": "What is slippage?",
  "footer.howto_slippage_p1": "Slippage is the difference between the price you expect for a trade and the price you actually get. It happens because prices move between the moment you submit a swap and the moment it executes on-chain.",
  "footer.howto_slippage_p2": "In thin or fast-moving markets\u2014common with memecoins\u2014slippage can be significant. Most swap interfaces let you set a slippage tolerance (e.g. 0.5\u20133%). If the price moves more than your tolerance, the transaction reverts instead of executing at a worse price.",
  "footer.howto_slippage_tip": "Lower tolerance = more protection but more failed txs. Higher tolerance = more likely to fill but worse possible price. Start conservative and adjust.",
